			<h4 id="textjoe">A copypasta:</h4>
			<div id="jumbotron">What I think people who are not in the greek System need to understand is that partying isn't just something we do.
			It's ingrained into our lives. Many people, these days, are perfectly content with sitting on their computers all day playing video games. I used to be a competitive gamer and I used to do this. After joining the Greek system, partying became a new norm that was ingrained into my life. We need it for our wellbeing. It helps us escape society. There have even been studies that show how necessary gatherings are for our wellbeing. The fact that it was stripped away from us, especially by something that barely affects us specifically is very detrimental to our mental state. People are giving us so much crap for it, yet they don't know what it's like for us to be deprived of everything that's fun for us.</div>
			<span>(this was in response to criticism aimed towards UW Greek life after their continued partying resulted in a recent outbreak of covid-19 that made national headlines)</span>
			<p class="thickjoe">Below is an unordered list of fun facts about me. If you go into the code, you'll also see how to mark specific words or phrases for emphasis or highlighting.</p> 
			<ul>
				<li>I'm a junior at UWB, majoring in <a class="majorname" href="https://www.uwb.edu/culture-literature-arts">Culture, Literature & the Arts</a> and <a class="majorname" href="https://www.uwb.edu/media-communication">Media & Communication Studies</a> with a minor in Computer Science</li>
				<li>I like to play music, and I've been <em>writing my own</em> lately.</li>
				<li>I'm also a <strong>huge</strong> gamer and also <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/ChessPiece21?own=1&subtype=boardgame&ff=1">play board games</a> as well, you can see my collection on that link.</li>
				<li>I go by <a href="https://github.com/ChessPiece21">ChessPiece21</a> or ChessPiece99 on a variety of websites. It comes from "ChessPiece1999," which was my old Newgrounds username from 2010 to 2011. It's a combination of my age/birth year and the fact that I used to play chess when I was younger.</li>
			</ul>

			<p id="textjoe">My Ranking of the 4 <a class="majorname" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schurniverse/">Schurniverse Sitcoms:</a></p>
			<ol>
				<li><em>Parks & Rec</em>: Absolutely iconic, so many great characters and moments. Score: <strong>10/10</strong>.</li>
				<li><em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em>: Also iconic, plus it has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffyKY3Dj5ZE">the best Backstreet Boys reference in history</a>. Score: <strong>Also 10/10</strong>.</li>
				<li><em>The Good Place</em>: I don't love it as much as the others, but I don't hate it either. The early seasons are great but the show got too repetitive for me until the end. Score: <strong>7/10</strong>.</li>
				<li><em>(unrankable) Rutherford Falls</em>: I haven't watched this yet, but it's brand new!</li>
