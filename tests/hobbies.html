        <p>Basketball has been a hobby of mine since middle school. I have always found that playing a game of pickup
          helps alleviate stress and get my mind off of things that may be stressing me. Often times you would be able
          to find me playing at my local college courts in Wenatchee but now that I am over in Bothell I have had a hard
          time finding a good court to play at.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Video Games</h1>
        <p>I have been playing video games since I was around 4 years old, starting out with a DS and a variety of Mario
          Games really kicked off my love for video games. Over the years I evolved from the DS and acquired a range of
          consoles such as PS2, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Etc. Currently I am actually gaming on the PC I built my senior year
          of High School, some of the games I play are, Escape from Tarkov, Phasmophobia, Minecraft (Timeless classic),
          and Hunt: Showdown. That being said, between school and work I haven't had too much time to actually enjoy any
          of the games I play but hopefully during summer I can get back into it</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Enjoying Nature</h1>
        <p> Being amongst nature is a hobby of mine that I hold close to my heart. Sometimes I find it hard to distract myself from society and all the qualms that come with it, when that happens I find it best to just take a break and go on a walk through the woods or whatever non-human developed nature area I can find. It's so calming to hear nothing but the wind and birds chirping, it really just helps me seperate a bit from society and often has me leaving with a greater understanding of life through my peaceful thinking out there.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Gaining Higher Knowledge</h1>
        <p>Educating myself further has always been a goal of mine and has turnt into somewhat of a hobby. I believe in the idea that knowledge is power and believe that we as humans should be doing everything in our power to expand our knowledge. That being said at this point in life I can't do much but educate myself, school has been a major part of that but even outside of school I try to make learn as much as possible whether it comes  from work or whatever I am doing. I hope whatever life throws me that this hobby is the one I  can stick with as I believe it betters me as a human</p>
